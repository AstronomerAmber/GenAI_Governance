The virtual meetup for the global MLflow user and contributor base, January 30, 2025 (GMT -0800).

This month's presentations:

- ​Explore how to utilize Unity Catalog to safely store, use, and integrate your python functions for use in GenAI Agent applications. In this demo, we'll go through how to use the Unity Catalog AI function client, how to store functions for use in multiple Agent authoring libraries, and how using MLflow's tracing capabilities allow you to inspect the inner workings of complex tool-calling agents with no additional work or configuration needed. (Ben Wilson, MLflow maintainer)

- ​MLflow Tracing is an observability feature designed for debugging, evaluating, and monitoring your GenAI application. We'll highlight 15+ integrations and key improvements we've made this year, and preview exciting updates for 2025, including human annotation, metrics integration, and more! (Daniel Lok and Yuki Watanabe, MLflow maintainers)
